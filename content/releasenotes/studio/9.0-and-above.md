## 2021

### March 31st, 2021

#### New Features 

* We introduced a new visual language – [workflows](/studio/workflows). Workflow is a visual language in Mendix Studios that allows you to build extendable processes. It is fully integrated with other visual languages, such as the microflow editor and page editor. Workflows is a visual way of expressing application logic and looks like a flow chart:

    * The Workflow editor comes with a brand-new expression editor for decision activities and due date conditions. The expression editor provides you the capabilities to write conditions using your app data, functions, mathematical and logical operations. It is easy to use and yet extremely expressive.

* We added support for [Studio Pro 9.0.5](../studio-pro/9.0) – the GA version. 

### March 11th, 2021

#### Improvements

* We replaced references to App Store with references to the new Marketplace, for example, in the page editor toolbox. You can use the integrated search to discover and download widgets from the Marketplace.

### February 25th, 2021

#### Improvements

* We overhauled Studio with a modern and clean design and fresh icons.
* To improve the user experience, we added a clear message that appears when trying to open an app project with Studio disabled for it.

### February 12th,2021

#### Improvements

* If Marketplace modules are added to your app project in Studio Pro, you can use the layouts of these modules. Previously this was not possible.  

### January 28th, 2021

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where you could open microflows from the System and Marketplace modules in Studio.

### January 21st, 2021

#### Improvements

* We improved the design of **Select** dialog boxes for better user experience:

    {{% image_container width="350" %}}![Select Dialog Box](attachments/9.0/select-dialog.png){{% /image_container %}}

* You no longer have to re-login after you were inactive for eight or more hours, Studio will keep you logged in automatically. 

#### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where list views were not filled with data from external entities when you previewed or published your app. 

### January 13th, 2021

#### Fixes

* <a name="publish"></a>We are now using MendixSSO 2.3.0 for model versions above 8.12.5, which fixes the publishing issue in Studio.
