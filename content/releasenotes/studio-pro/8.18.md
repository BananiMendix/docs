## 8.18.4 {#8184}

**Release date: April 1st, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.4" %}}

### Fixes

* We fixed a performance regression in loop execution. (Ticket 118288)
We fixed the **list subtraction** operation, which now maintains the order of items. (Ticket 117625)
* We improved the validity of sessions in session caches. As a result, changes made on one cluster node will now eventually be reflected on others. Also, `Core.getSessionById` will update the current session and related data in the current cluster node's session cache if the session validation timeout is passed. (Ticket 113448)
* We fixed an issue with the document template when a conditionally visible row was always rendered if the enclosing data view had an empty object. (Ticket 115502)
* We fixed an issue where revisions that were already merged were not shown as unavailable when doing a subsequent advanced merge from the same branch. (Ticket 117916)
* We fixed an issue where you got an incorrect success message when uploading your app to a version control server failed.
* We fixed an issue that resulted in non-unique document names when copying a document and pasting it in the same module.

## 8.18.3 {#8183}

**Release date: March 17th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.3" %}}

### Improvements

* When running an app without a license, the [Data Hub limitation on the number of objects](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service-requirements) no longer applies.
* We improved the performance of domain model interactions when the search functionality is used in [Data Hub](/data-hub/).
* We added a read-only **App repository address** field to the [private-server Sign In box](/refguide8/upload-to-version-control-dialog#private-server), so now you know what private repository you are connecting to. For more information, see [How to Work with an On-Premises Version Control Server](/howto8/collaboration-requirements-management/on-premises-svn-howto).
* We upgraded the JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server to version 9.2.0. If you use the [Database Connector](/appstore/connectors/database-connector) module with SQL Server and integrated security, you may need to update the JDBC driver in `userlib` as well.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where multiple sessions did not work as expected in offline applications when [Multiple users per session](/refguide8/project-settings#multiple-sessions) was turned off. (Ticket 113783)
* We fixed an issue in native mobile apps where the bottom bar was rendered incorrectly on recent iOS devices. (Ticket 117412)
* We fixed an issue where negative numeric values were formatted incorrectly in CSV exports. (Ticket 114902)
* The header on the login page of Atlas UI can now be translated using the new system text `mendix.signin.loginHeader`. (Ticket 116249)
* We fixed an issue with an option of the [Close page](/refguide8/close-page) nanoflow activity that controls how many pages to close where it was no longer possible to select **Single** after you had selected **Multiple**. (Ticket 116323)
* We fixed an issue where creating the [deployment package](/refguide8/create-deployment-package-dialog) for an app failed. (Ticket 117393)
* We fixed an issue with the editable [data grid](/refguide8/data-grid) where the default German date format was not recognized. (Ticket 117168)
* We fixed an issue in the [file manager](/refguide8/file-manager) widget that caused unexpected extensions to be invalid (for example, *.PDF*, *.pDf*). (Ticket 116909)
* Documentation in Studio Pro 9 Guide was opened via <kbd>F1</kbd> and **Help** instead of [Studio Pro 8 Guide](/refguide8/). This has been fixed.
* We fixed a bug that was causing a crash whenever an app was opened that needed to merge changes introduced from outside Studio Pro.
* We improved the process of [reverting all changes](/refguide8/version-control-menu#revert-all). You will no longer be asked to save before reverting. We also fixed a crash that occurred when you reverted while the app was running.

### Deprecations

* We will drop support for Oracle 18 before June 30th. We will announce this again when the support is dropped.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

## 8.18.2 {#8182}

**Release date: March 8th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.2" %}}

### Improvements

* We upgraded the Swagger UI component for viewing the [Open API specification](/refguide8/open-api) for [published REST services](/refguide8/published-rest-services) from 3.31.1 to 3.40.
* As part of ongoing maintenance, we reduced the memory footprint and improved the performance of Studio Pro and [MxBuild](/refguide8/mxbuild).
* We added [support](/refguide8/system-requirements#databases) for PostgreSQL 13.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue in [published OData services](/refguide8/published-odata-services) where an error occurred when a client queried the service using `$select` in combination with expanding (`$expand`) an association from the child's side. (Ticket 113523)
* We fixed an issue in [consumed web services](/refguide8/consumed-web-services) that logged a message "Operation getFaultNode not supported" when calling a SOAP 1.1 web service even though there was no problem. (Ticket 114070)
* We fixed an issue in [published REST service](/refguide8/published-rest-services) POST operations with file form parameters where an empty file was written to storage when the body did not contain a part for it. Now, no file is written to storage. (Ticket 114991)
* We fixed an issue where adding a snippet call without a snippet led to an error. (Ticket 114041)
* We fixed an issue where the **View** > **Phone/Tablet** options did not work for apps deployed to Mendix Cloud. (Ticket 114471)
* When an average of a list is calculated by the database, the result is no longer truncated. (Tickets 111779, 112782)
* We updated access rules for the userâ€™s password attribute to prevent access to its hashed value.
* We fixed a bug where an incorrect number of revisions was shown after a successful update.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

## 8.18.1 {#8181}

**Release date: February 1st, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.1" %}}

### Improvements

* We updated the [SAP HANA](/refguide8/saphana) driver to 2.7.9.
* We now allow JDBC URL options to set data source properties for SAP HANA.
* We disabled the `transactionalLobs` option in SAP HANA.
* We improved the performance of the `Core.getActiveSession(userName)` method.

### Fixes

* We fixed a runtime issue in [Call REST](/refguide8/call-rest-action) activities when calling endpoints that keep the connection alive. The issue occurred in Mendix Cloud v4- and AWS-hosted apps, because those environments sever connections after 6 minutes. Setting `http.client.CleanupAfterSeconds` to `355` fixes that issue, so now we use that as the default value. (Tickets 110860, 111317, 111881, 112067, 112073, 113401, 113920)
* We fixed a runtime issue in Call REST activities where trace logging changed the contents of responses. (Tickets 112613, 113750, 114499, 114516)
* We fixed an issue where conditional visibility on a pluggable widget (or a widget inside a pluggable widget) did not work correctly if the pluggable widget was inside a snippet. (Ticket 113612)
* We fixed an error in the runtime where a widget retrieved over 1000 records. (Ticket 108750)
* We fixed an issue where calling a microflow from an [offline-first](/refguide8/offline-first) application triggered an unnecessary reload of data sources on the opened pages. (Ticket 114660)
* We fixed an issue in native mobile apps where a focused text input was hidden behind the keyboard on Android devices. Make sure to also update your versions of the [Make It Native app](/releasenotes/mobile/make-it-native-app) and [Native Builder](/releasenotes/mobile/native-builder). (Ticket 113397)
* We fixed an issue where errors occurred when performing certain operations (for example, moving documents) when certain custom widgets existed in your app.

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.

## 8.18.0 {#8180}

**Release date: January 26th, 2021**

{{% modelerdownloadlink "8.18.0" %}}

### New Features

#### Selective Synchronization

When building offline-first apps, there are different scenarios to prepare for, and sometimes you may want to only synchronize a single object or a small set of objects instead of all the data. Good news, we have extended the synchronization capabilities with the option to only synchronize selected objects from the device with the server. Now, the power is in your hands and the choice is yours. Use the [Synchronize](/refguide8/synchronize) activity in a nanoflow to synchronize all or selected objects (which can be both objects and files). This feature can greatly improve the user experience of your app and offers more flexibility.

For more information, see the [Synchronization](/refguide8/offline-first#synchronization) section of *Offline-First*.

#### The Future of Mobile Apps

At Mendix, we want to provide our customers with a future-proof platform, a significant part of which is always determined by underlying technology. We believe that [native mobile apps](https://www.mendix.com/blog/mobile-apps-go-native-part-i/) and [progressive web apps (PWAs)](https://www.mendix.com/mobile-architecture/#progressive-web-apps) are the future for mobile apps, in that they deliver a best-of-breed approach for building app store- and browser-based mobile apps. For more information, see the [Establishing Your Mobile Architecture Strategy](https://www.mendixworld.com/session/establishing-your-mobile-architecture-strategy/) session from last year's Mendix World.

We do not consider hybrid mobile (which is based on Cordova) to be future-proof technology anymore. Therefore, we would like to inform you that we have disabled the creation of hybrid mobile apps in this version of Studio Pro and have deprecated hybrid mobile apps in Studio Pro [9](9.0). 

For more information, see [Mendix Is First-to-Market with Expanded "All-in-One" Low-Code Platform; Launches Pre-Packaged Industry Apps for Even Faster Adoption of Low-Code in the Enterprise](https://www.mendix.com/press/mendix-is-first-to-market-with-expanded-all-in-one-low-code-platform-launches-pre-packaged-industry-apps-for-even-faster-adoption-of-low-code-in-the-enterprise/).

#### Support for Non-Filterable & Non-Sortable Attributes

We added support for attributes that cannot be used for filtering or sorting. Previously, it was not possible to consume non-filterable or non-sortable attributes. Now it is possible to consume these attributes, extending what can you do with data from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/).

To better support OData for Mendix Data Hub, we added the concept of [attribute limitations](/refguide8/attributes#limitations). Sometimes attributes in OData do not support sorting or filtering, and now Studio Pro is aware of that. Studio Pro shows an error to warn you when you do something with an attribute that is not possible, while allowing you to use the attributes for everything else.

The concept of attribute limitations is now extended to existing attribute types. This does not change their functionality (because these attribute types always had some restrictions), and now they behave the same as other non-filterable and non-sortable attributes.

### Improvements

* We added consistency checks to ensure the uniqueness of exposed names and exposed set names for published OData resources.
* We added a new way to specify which client certificate to use in the [Call REST service](/refguide8/call-rest-action) and [Call web service](/refguide8/call-web-service-action) activities.
* We improved the user interface for modeling [published OData services](/refguide8/published-odata-services) in Studio Pro. The old tree view of published attributes and associations is now a list.
* We now show the associations of [external entities](/refguide8/external-entities) in the [Data Hub pane](/refguide8/data-hub-pane). Multiple associations between the same pair of external entities are grouped together, listing individual associations in the tooltip. Unsupported associations are grayed out and show a tooltip explaining the reason.
* The [Commit](/refguide8/committing-objects) activity is now included in **Find usages** results.

### Fixes

* We fixed an issue where certain operations on binaries were only possible within a sudo context.
    {{% alert type="info" %}}Thanks to Marcel Groenweg for pointing this out!
    {{% /alert %}}
* We fixed an issue regarding the [Change list](/refguide8/change-list) microflow activity where if a list was set to itself, the contents were cleared. (Ticket 109243)
* We fixed several possible data synchronization issues that occurred in offline-first applications. (Ticket 101598)
* We fixed an issue where the [reference selector](/refguide8/reference-selector) widget did not show objects when used in an offline-first application. (Ticket 113384)
* We fixed an issue where a native mobile application failed to load during development. (Ticket 112952)
* We fixed an issue **View** > [Find](/refguide8/view-menu#find) did not find the text that was typed as [published REST operation](/refguide8/published-rest-operation) documentation. (Ticket 112648)
* We fixed an issue for published OData services where the app's default proxy settings were not used at runtime. (Ticket 109953)
* We fixed an issue where dynamic classes were not applied for [layout grid](/refguide8/layout-grid) rows and cells, [table](/refguide8/table) rows and cells, [scroll container](/refguide8/scroll-container) regions, and [data grid](/refguide8/data-grid) columns. We also fixed an issue where these were also not applied to the container widget. (Tickets 111048, 111810, 112312)
* When an XPath constraint used the `%CurrentObject%` token in a nested constraint, this resulted in an error in the client. This is now fixed. (Ticket 112034)
* When migrating files created before Mendix 6 to modern files, we now log the missing files instead of failing the migration. (Tickets 110317, 110969)
* We decreased the chance of deadlocks in our session administration system actions, and when deadlocks still occur, they are handled gracefully. (Ticket 111360)
* We fixed an issue that caused [Close page](/refguide8/close-page) activities to stop working after upgrading to [8.17](8.17). (Ticket 111576)
* We fixed an error where an error message appeared when you dragged a microflow onto the list of published REST operations and clicked **Cancel** on the dialog box.
* We fixed an issue in published OData services where publishing associations in a combination of entities with generalizations resulted in an incorrect contract.
* We fixed an issue where the picker element of an inline native [drop-down](/refguide8/drop-down) widget did not update on a selected value change when opened.
* We fixed an issue where the current branch was showing in the list of available branches to [merge](/refguide8/merge-dialog).

### Known Issues

* When you update a [consumed OData service](/refguide8/consumed-odata-service) with a new version from [Mendix Data Hub](/data-hub/) but close the document without saving, the blue arrow icon will no longer be shown to notify you about the available update for that service.
	* Workaround: Closing your app and opening it again fixes this issue.
