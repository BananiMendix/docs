## 1 Introduction 

In this document, we explain how to solve complex consistency errors that can occur when configuring [workflows](workflows) in Mendix Studio. For more information on workflows, see [Workflows](workflows).

An example of a consistency error is when you did not select a page for a new user task. 

{{% alert type="info" %}}

This document does not describe *all* the errors, as there are a lot of errors that can occur, some of which are simple and do not need extra explanation, others are rare and/or heavily dependent on a use-case. 

{{% /alert %}}

Some errors have error codes and if these errors are described in documentation, Studio has a clickable link to the corresponding document. Others do not have an error code, in this case, you can manually search whether a particular error is described in documentation (you can search by using the message text that is displayed in the **Checks** panel).

## 2 Workflows Consistency Errors 

The most common yet complex errors you can come across when configuring a workflow are described in the table below:

| Error Code | Message in the Checks Panel                                  | Element Where the Error Occurs                    | Cause of the Error                                           | Way to Fix                                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CE6685     | The parameters of the selected microflow have changed, please update them in the properties. | [Call Microflow](workflow-system-actions) action  | When parameters of the selected microflow have been changed, for example, one more parameter was added, a parameter was deleted, or a parameter type was changed. | Open the **Call Microflow** properties > **Outcomes** and click **Refresh**. |
| CE6686     | The current outcomes of the call microflow activity do not match the configured microflow. Regenerate the outcomes. | [Call Microflow](workflow-system-actions) action  | Current outcomes set in **Call Microflow** properties are no longer up-to-date. This happens when changing a return value of a microflow, for example, when a return value has been changed from enumeration type to Boolean. | Open the **Call Microflow** properties > **Outcomes** and click **Refresh**. |
| CE0078     | Condition should be of type Boolean or enumeration but is of type {type of condition}. | [Decision](workflows-general-activities#decision) | For more information on this error, see the [Properties Not Set Consistency Errors](consistency-errors-microflows#properties-not-set) section in *Microflow Consistency Errors*. | For more information on this error, see the [Properties Not Set Consistency Errors](consistency-errors-microflows#properties-not-set) section in *Microflow Consistency Errors*. |
| CE0079     | The 'true' case should be configured in properties for an outgoing flow. <br />or<br />The 'false' case should be configured in properties for an outgoing flow. | [Decision](workflows-general-activities#decision) | For more information on this error, see the [Properties Set Incorrectly Consistency Errors](consistency-errors-microflows#properties-set-incorrectly) section in *Microflow Consistency Errors*. | For more information on this error, see the [Properties Set Incorrectly Consistency Errors](consistency-errors-microflows#properties-set-incorrectly) section in *Microflow Consistency Errors*. |
