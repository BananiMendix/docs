## 1 Introduction

This guide describes how to use the [DataHubAPI](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) for searching and registering your data sources from your business applications to Data Hub. 

The [DataHubAPI](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) is published as an OpenAPI 3.0 (formerly Swagger) specification which enables you to visualize the API. It has the latest and complete documentation on the calls that can be made which you can try out. This how-to will guide you through the main processes for searching the Data Hub and registering your data sources. 

You can see how search, registration and consume using Data Hub works by working through the how-to [Share Data Between Apps](/data-hub/share-data) . This also demonstrates the integrated functionality of Data Hub in Mendix Studio Pro for registering and consuming data sources. 

Using the Data Hub API you can create a deployment process for your apps to register OData v3 and OData v4 services that define your shared data sources to your organization's Data Hub. Using the API you can also search for suitable data sources that you can use in your app development.

{{% alert type="info" %}}To use the Mendix Data Hub a license is required. {{% /alert %}}

**This how-to will teach you how to do use the API to do the following:**

- Search the catalog for a string of characters – [Searching in the Catalog](#api-search)
- Register the service in the Catalog – [Registration](#reg-contract)
- Register consumed datasets by an App – [Registering Consumed Endpoints](#consumed-ep)

You can try out the calls described by following the examples that are provided in the accompanying document: [Data Hub API Examples](data-hub-api-how-to-examples). The values for the call bodies are included and also a sample OData v3 file that you can use to try the registration calls.

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following:

- Have a registered Mendix Data Hub account
- Obtain your own Personal Access Token (PAT) as described in [Generating your Personal Access Token](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/data-hub-apis#generatepat) to authenticate your API requests

## 3 Overview of the Data Hub API

The following list provides an overview the Data Hub API:

- The latest Data Hub API is available at: [http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/).
- The base URL for all calls to the API is: https://hub.mendix.com/rest/datahubservice/v2/.
- All requests to the Data Hub API must include the access token ([PAT](#pat)) to gain access to the organization’s Data Hub. For more details see: [API calls and Access to Data Hub](#access).
- Refer to [OpenAPI 3.0 spec](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) for the full specification details and responses.
- The following operations can be carried out using the Data Hub API:

  - Search for registered assets (data sources, datasets, attributes and associations) in the Catalog using [GET /data](#api-search)

  - Register data sources (OData services):
    The following requests must be made in the given order using the returned UUID values for the subsequent step:

    1. Register the application that the dataset originates from: [POST applications](#api-search)

    2. Register the environment that the dataset is deployed to: [POST environment](#api-search)

    3. Register the published services (data source) of the application: [PUT published endpoints](#put-service)

  - Register consumed services (data sources) and entities by an application: [PUT consumed endpoints](#consumed-ep)

## 4 Making the API Calls and Access to Data Hub {#access}

This how-to guides users in using the Data Hub API. For the complete definitions of all the schemas that make up the API and the parameters and objects that must be provided and are returned, refer to the [Data Hub OpenAPI 3.0 spec](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com).

For each request described in this document, the method and URL is given for the base call with a description of the parameters and body that may be required for the request. An example is given for each of the calls described here in [Data Hub API Examples](data-hub-api-how-to-examples) so that you can try out the calls.

For some examples, an example [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) command is also given. You must enter the specifics for your own registration such as the returned values for your requests and you PAT token value.

{{% alert type="info" %}}curl is an open-source tool curl that is pre-installed on many Linux and macOS systems. Windows users can download a version at curl.haxx.se. When using HTTPS on Windows, ensure that your system meets the curl requirements for SSL. {{% /alert %}}

### 4.1 Access {#pat}

To gain access to your organization’s Data Hub you must include your personal access token ([PAT](/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/data-hub-apis#generatepat)). *Authorization* is not required for your API calls, however, you must include the following key:value pair as part of the *header* for *each* request:

​   `Authorization`: `MxToken <your_PAT_Token>`.

Insert the value of your PAT token for the string <*your token*>.

#### 4.1.1 Using Postman

If you prefer to use a tool with a graphical user interface when working with APIs, you can use a REST API client, for example, [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/). When using Postman, for each request, provide the request URI, the HTTP method, and, if required, the request parameters and body.

Access to your Data Hub is specified in the request **Header** using the key `Authorization` and setting the value to this key as `MxToken <your_PAT_Token>` (inserting the value of your PAT token for the string `<your_PAT_Token>`). 

You can set your PAT token as a variable that can be conveniently called for each request.

#### 4.1.2 Using a Command Line Tool such as Curl

If you are using the [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) command to send your HTTP requests to the API then you must include the access header as given in this example of a GET call: 

`curl --location --request GET 'https://hub.mendix.com/rest/datahubservice/v2/data' \
--header 'Authorization: MxToken <your_PAT_Token>' \`

Insert the value of your PAT token for the string <*your token*> for every request that you make.

### 4.2 Base Variables Used in the How-to

For convenience and conciseness, throughout this how-to the following variables are used and should be substituted by the relevant values or those that are returned in prior responses:

* {{baseURL}} — the base URL for the Data Hub API: https://hub.mendix.com/rest/datahubservice/v2/data
* {*AppUUID}* — insert the value returned in the API response for the UUID of the application
* {*EnvironmentUUID*} – insert the value returned in the API response for the UUID of the environment
* ```<your_PAT_Token>``` – insert the value of your [PAT](https://docs.mendix.com/apidocs-mxsdk/apidocs/data-hub-apis#generatepat) as described in [Access](#pat)

## 5 Searching in the Catalog{#api-search}

Search in the Catalog returns the registered assets that satisfy the search string and specified filters. The search is carried out on all discoverable registered assets in the Catalog (data sources, data sets, attributes, and descriptions of the registered items). For more details see [Searching in the Data Hub]( /data-hub/data-hub-catalog/search).

To try out an example search request using the call described in this section, see [Searching for Registered Assets in the Catalog that have the string: `sample`](data-hub-api-how-to-examples#get-data-ex)

### 5.1 Method and Endpoint

`GET /data`

### 5.2 Request Parameters

The complete list of request parameters for the call are provided at [Data Hub OpenAPI 3.0 spec](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com).

The `query` parameter is used to specify the string that you want to search for. The string must be a minimum of 3 characters, and can include alphanumeric characters only. All other characters are not allowed for the search string.

The `productionEndpointsOnly` parameter is a Boolean, which when set to `true` will only search for assets in **Production** environments. `false` will search in all environments.

### 5.3 Successful 200 OK Response

A successful 200 response returns the all assets from the Data Hub that satisfy the search string and the specified filters in the JSON object `SearchResults`.

All the assets (items registered) in the Catalog that will be searched. For each of the assets the items in the metadata that will be searched and therefore included in the search results are the following:

- **Endpoint (data sources, services)**: Name, Description, Tags
- **Application**: Name
- **Entity (dataset)**: Name, Description
- **Attribute**: Name, Description
- **Association**: Name

#### 5.3.1 Data Returned for the `SearchResults` Object {#api-search-results}

The `SearchResults` object includes the total number of items, `TotalResults`, that satisfy the search request and the `Data` object is the array of the endpoints of the objects that satisfy the search string.

For the full specification see the [OpenAPI 3.0 spec](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/).

#### 5.3.2 `Data` Objects

A representation of what is returned in the response for `Data` is shown below.

The blue indicates that an object that is made up of a collection (of further sub-objects, data and arrays); the red an array of data; and the solid outline indicates if the item is always returned in the response. Not all sub-levels of the schemas are shown in the representation below.

For the full specification, refer to the [OpenAPI 3.0 spec](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/).

## 6 Registering Applications, Environments, Data Sources {#reg-contract}

This section describes the steps for registering data sources – this can be OData v3 or OData v4 contracts. All the files that make up the contract must be included in the registration call.

A data source must be registered to an app deployed to a given environment. Therefore, registration of the app, environment and service must be done in the following order:

1. Register the application that the data source originates from: `POST application`
2. Register the environment that the data source is deployed to: `POST environment`
3. Register the services published by the application (data sources) : `PUT published-endpoints`

You can register the entities that are consumed by a registered app that consumes from a registered data source as described in [Registering Endpoints Consumed by an App](#consumed-ep). This information is maintained in the Data Hub Catalog and displayed in the [Data Hub Landscape](/data-hub/data-hub-landscape) showing the network of connected apps, data sources and dependent apps.

You can try out the example calls for registering a data source as described in [Registering an Example OData Contract](data-hub-api-how-to-examples#reg-contract-ex).

### 6.1 Registering an Application in the Catalog using POST

The first step is to register the application that the data source or service originates from.

{{% alert type="info" %}}If the application and environment of the service is already registered in the Catalog (for previously registered services, for example), you can proceed to [Registering the Published Services](#put-service) and use the `AppUUID` and `EnvUUID` as the input parameters. These objects can be obtained from search results as described in [Search request response](#api-search-results). {{% /alert %}}

You can try this call by following the example given in [Registering the Howto5-App](data-hub-api-how-to-examples#ex-reg-app).

#### 6.1.1 Method and Endpoint

`POST /applications`

#### 6.1.2 Request Body

There are no parameters to this request only a payload that specifies the details of the application to be registered. The mandatory data that must be included in this request is `Name`, and you can also further provide further details such as the location of files, the application that produced the application (`Type`), a description that will be displayed in the Catalog, and the owners of the app.

#### 6.1.3 Successful 201 POST Response

A successful 201 response will indicate that the application has been registered in the Catalog. The response will return an application `UUID`, which is the Catalog identifier for the registered app that must be used when referring to the application in the next steps of the registration.

### 6.2 Registering an Environment

The next step is to register the environment where the app and the service is deployed.

For apps deployed to multiple environements, there must be a separate call for each environment.

You can follow a real example in [Registering the Environment `Production`.](data-hub-api-how-to-examples#reg-env-ex)

#### 6.2.1 Method and Endpoint

`POST /applications/{AppUUID}/environments`

#### 6.2.2 Request Parameters and body

For this request, the mandatory parameter that must be provided is `AppUUID` that specifies the Catalog UUID for registered app.

The Request must be accompanied by a JSON format body that must include the following:

* Name – Name of the environment
* Location – Location of the environment
* Type – The environment type (Production, Non-Production, Sandbox, the Mendix Free App environment)

#### 6.2.3 Successful 201 POST Response

A 201 response indicates that the environment has been registered in the Catalog for the given application and returns the environment UUID for the environment.

The unique combination of the **App UUID** and the **environment UUID** is the identifier used to register any published endpoints (data sources or services) for the application that are deployed to this environment.

{{% alert type="info" %}}These UUIDs are the unique identifiers that are required for registering apps that consume the data sources as described in [registering consumed endpoints](#consumed-ep). {{% /alert %}}

### 6.3 Registering the Published Services {#put-service}

This section describes the register service call for registering the data sources or services (that are known as endpoints) published by an app deployed to a specific environment.

When there are several services published by an app, each service (service endpoint) can be included in a single request as a part of the collection of `Endpoints`.

{{% alert type="info" %}} OData service contract files must be included in the request body in escaped JSON format. There are several online converters available for converting your *.xml* files into this format such as one available from [Freeformatter.com](https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html#ad-output). Just paste the contents of your files and convert them to the escaped format. {{% /alert %}}

You can also try this out by following the example given in [Registering the 5how-toODatav3-sample-service.](data-hub-api-how-to-examples#reg-service-ex)

#### 6.3.1 Method and Endpoint

`PUT /applications/{AppUUID}/environments/{EnvironmentUUID}/published-endpoints`

#### 6.3.2 Request Parameters and Body

The parameters `AppUUID` and `EnvironmentUUID` of the deployed app are required as input parameters.

The request body is made up of the collection of objects for the `PutPublishedEndpointsRequest`. They include an array of the objects that define each service deployed by the app in the given environment – `Endpoints` .

When defining each service in the `ServiceVersion` object the details of the endpoints or service must be specified which includes the name, version number, and the location of the contract files that is provided by the relative path `Path` . The `Contracts` object contains the metadata files that form the contract and must be included in the body an escaped JSON string format.

A representation of the objects that can be specified for the request body is shown below. Not all of the sub-level arrays and objects are shown, for the full schema definition refer to the [OpenAPI 3.0 spec](http://datahub-spec.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/).

(Blue indicates that the constituent objects are a collection, the red an array, and the solid outline indicates if the object is required.)

![published endpoints mindmap](attachments/data-hub-api-how-to/putpublishedendpointsrequest.png)

{{% alert type="info" %}}

* When Odata contracts are made up of **several files**, all the files must be included for each service so that consumers will have access to the entire definition.

* If an **empty array** is sent for `ServiceVersion`, this it will be interpreted that the application in the environment does not publish any services with this request. However, this will not affect any previously registered services for this same application/environment.

* **Previously registered services** for the application/environment are not affected by a PUT endpoints request. Any services that are already registered for the application/environment will still continue to be registered. Therefore the PUT call has the affect of "adding" services.

* When there are **updates to a services**, care must be taken when deciding to register the new contract at the same endpoint (which means that the previous contract will be replaced) or to a different endpoint.We recommend that you use semantic numbering to indicate the severity of changes in the contract and that you follow a strict protocol when deciding on endpoints to ensure that apps consuming previous versions do not experience disruptions.

* If you want to **"remove" services** for an app, we recommend that you create a new version of the app, deployed to a different environment without the service you do not want included. In this way, you can maintain a historical version of the assets, and ensure that consumers are notified of the new version, without affecting those that are consuming the previous version. For more detail see [removing published services for a registered app](#remove-app)

{{% /alert %}}

#### 6.3.3 Successful 200 PUT Response

A successful 200 response returns the array of endpoints that are registered for the given environment and application.

A unique service `UUID` is returned for each for each service endpoint.

For each endpoint, the object `Links` provides the URL of the details page in the Catalog, and also the URI of the service files.

The response also includes the total number of applications/environments – `Connections` – that consume this endpoint. For further details see [registering consumed endpoints](#consumed-ep).

## 7 Registering Consumed Endpoints by an App using PUT {#consumed-ep}

For an app deployed to a specific environment you can register any datasets that it consumes by providing the endpoint details and the entities (datasets) that it consumes. This is registered in the Catalog for both assets and added to the number of **Connections** for the consumed service. This can also be seen in the Data Hub Landscape which displays the networks of publishing and consuming apps and the associated data sources.

{{% alert type="info" %}}The PUT call for registering consumed entities will *update* the currently registered datasets for an app/environment. This means that when you want to *add* consumed endpoints to an app (indicating the services that an app is consuming), all previously registered consumed endpoints must be included in the request payload of the new request. If the previously registered consumed endpoints are not included, the result will be that they will be *removed*. {{% /alert %}}

You can also try this out by following the example given in [Registering Consumed Endpoints by the Howto5-App](data-hub-api-how-to-examples#consumed-ep-ex).

### 7.1 Method and Endpoint

`PUT /applications/{AppUUID}/environments/{EnvironmentUUID}/consumed-endpoints`

### 7.2 Request Parameters and body

The request must include a body that defines an array of the objects consumed by the application.

Both parameters `AppUUID` and `EnvironmnetUUID` are required for the app that is consuming a data source or service.

The Request body comprises an array of consumed endpoints `ConsumedEndpointRequestDetails`.

For every consumed endpoint the unique identifier of the absolute URL of the endpoint must be provided for the `EndpointLocation`.
The `ConsumedItems` includes the name of the `EntitySet` that is consumed and the `Namespace` of the entity set to ensure that the correct consumed dataset can be registered.

{{% alert type="info" %}}Some apps may have the same named `Entityset` which are included in several different `Namespaces` therefore, while `Namespace` is not required, it is recommended that you include it to ensure that the correct dataset is accessed. {{% /alert %}}

The following is a representation of the request body. (Blue indicates that the constituent objects are a collection, the red an array, and the solid outline indicates if the object is required.)

![published endpoints mindmap](attachments/data-hub-api-how-to/putconsumedendpointsrequest.png)

### 7.3 Successful 200 POST Response

The 200 OK response returns an array of the consumed endpoints. It returns the full details of each registered consumed endpoint and the catalog UUIDs of them. The total number of connections made to the consumed service is updated and returned to include this registration.

## 8 Removing Published Services for a Registered App {#remove-app}

The [PUT endpoints](#put-service) request does not affect any previously registered services for the application/environment combination. Sending an empty PUT endpoints request will not overwrite previously registered services. Therefore the PUT endpoints has the affect of "adding" services to an app in a specific environment

### 8.1 Removing Services Deployed to an App/Environment

When you have a situation where you want to remove a published service for an app, we recommend that you create a new version of the app, deployed to a different environment, without the service you want to remove.

For example:

**App1.0** publishes the following services

* App-1-premierservice1.0
* App-1-secondaryservice1.0
* App-1-tertiaryservice1.0

If you now want to remove **App-1-secondaryservice1.0** api to **App1.0** then a copy of App 1.0 can be made called **App1.1** and the secondary deleted from the published services.

**App 1.1** therefore publishes the following services:

* App-1-premierservice1.0
* App-1-tertiaryservice1.0

In this example, the services in the two apps, must now be maintained in both apps and owners of the apps consuming from the first app should be notified about the latest version of the app that is available.

In this way, you can maintain a historical version of the registered assets, and ensure that consumers are notified of the new version, without affecting those that are consuming the previous version and giving them time to migrate. 

### 8.2 Services Versions and Endpoints

When there are updates to a services, care must be taken when deciding whether to deploy the new contract at the same endpoint or to a different endpoint as the changes may affect consuming apps.

Contract files deployed to the same endpoint of a registered service will mean that consuming apps must reload the changed contract. 

We recommend that you use semantic numbering for service versions to maintain a historical record and indicate the severity of changes. Further you should implement a strict protocol that defines when updates are deployed to previoulsy registered endpoints. 

In all cases, you are advised to notify all consumers of changes and also new versions deployed to new endpoints. 

## 9 Sample Contract File {#sample-contract}

The following file is an example OData v3 contract that you can use for in this how-to for the PUT registration service request. The format provided below is in escaped JSON format contract and you can copy it and directly insert it in the PUT request body.

### Metadata {#ex-metadata}
