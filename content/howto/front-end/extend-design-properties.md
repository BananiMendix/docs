## 1 Introduction

Design properties make it simple to change the appearance of widgets. These changes can include properties like colors, borders, and spacing. Out of the box, the Atlas framework comes with a default set of design properties which can be extended.

Design properties are based on the classes in the styling for both web apps and native mobile apps. Basically a design property toggles a class.

In both Studio and Studio Pro, design properties are visible as part of the widget properties:
