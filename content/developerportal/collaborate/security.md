## 1 Introduction

In **Security**, there are two tabs with team and node permissions, as described below.

## 2 App Team {#app-team}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
To view the team, you must have the **App Settings** permission or a default **Scrum Master** role.
{{% /alert %}}

The **App Team** tab lets you view and delete the team members that are currently working on the app as well as invite new members to the team.

Each member has a **Role**. You can change the role of each team member to the following:

* Application Director
* Application Operator
* Business Engineer
* End-user
* Performance Engineer/Tester
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master

Click **Role Settings** to see permission details for these roles. For more information, see [App Roles](/developerportal/collaborate/app-roles).

## 3 Node Permissions {#node-permissions}

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Node permissions are only available for Licensed Apps.
{{% /alert %}}

The **Node Permissions** tab lets you view the team members that have the team permission to view, deploy, and monitor the node.  A **Technical Contact** can grant those team members certain permissions.

For more information, see [Node Permissions](/developerportal/deploy/node-permissions).
